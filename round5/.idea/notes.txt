if player gets hit anywhere on the map(not only in the fight zone) it will change state to STATE.FIGHT

maybe we need to add a STATE.RUNAWAY if we get hit when we are not in fight zone, they we keep running

for missing food, we at least one of the food listed in the provided list. and we can get like 5 of it

must learn more about lambda expressions

just used demorgans law in java, fucking mind blowen, the negation of A or B is not A and not B

what if POTIONA is out, but POTIONB is not yet but almost out,
 -does the script only get more POTIONA, or it gets POTIONA and POTIONb
    -if thats the case, what does it mean to be 'almost' out
 -for now, we gunna have bots run alot by not have 'almost' out, they just gunna get what they dont have
 -OR
 -there should be a NPC at GE that mix half doses together
 -that can be done at the end of the day


 taking pot from the bank: i check twice if it contains and if it is more than 5, is that redundant?
 -its not since you can get amount of something that does not already contain, so it is necessary

 the rate at which onLoop refreshes might affect the quality of banking

 read up on iterator and iterable, and how to use hasnext

 bank will always withdraw 10 food, and 5 each potions

 TODO: banking food makes the food into an arrayList

 script must start with BOTH potions in the inventory, or nullpointer exception will occur

 random thought, airplane traveling isnt that bad when you think about how humans gunna be going to mars in a few years

 when couples try to play their video together so that they are in sync

 how to fix the white space indentation? ctrl + l? alt + ctrl + l?????

BUG: taking pot from bank have the issue of there must be enough room in the inventroy(should be enough), to take item from bank into inventory


I have a loop
i need to go throgh the loop one by one
i need to test each element with a condition, if all condition fails (does inventory contain), then it will be different state
if condition is true then we run a statment & we also stop the looping process
if we run out of element in the loop, we also stop the loop


while (iterator.hasNext() || )
