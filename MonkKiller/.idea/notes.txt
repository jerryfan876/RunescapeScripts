1)area can contain my player
 EDGEVILLE_MONASTERY.contains(api.myPlayer());

2) state is writen as a venn diagram almost, or a tree, where it starts with one then it can branch in to more
specific things to get different states

3) when picking who to fight, there must be memory of who is player fighting
ie. opponent == null; in order for me to search for new
if not null, then you have a target already

4) This is important in finding the next npc
(Filter<NPC>) npc -> npc.getName().equals("Monk") && npc.getHealthPercent() > 0
